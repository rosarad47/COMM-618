Hi - I wanted to ask if I could write about how many Black students are attending charter schools versus public schools and consider how this number is changing over the years. I think this could be an interesting question to consider as there is a lot of debate as to whether charter schools or public schools are “better” and there is some tension between who receives more funding and whether that aspect of things is fair too. I know since the pandemic started that this number may have changed, so I would be curious to explore that too.

I have included a data set below that could help answer this question and I would like to take it a step further and look by ward, which is information I believe could be found on the DCPS or OSSE website. I found a line graph on the Washington Post website that I believe is a good place to start, and I think taking it a step further by considering race will be an interesting perspective. Since there is often discussion of how equitable schools are in DC, I would be curious to learn more about whether charter school vs. public school attendance informs a certain narrative. I think this data set is a great place to start because it starts with the enrollment numbers and emphasizes how those have increased, which makes me wonder: is there more to the story as to how those numbers have been divided? I also trust the Washington Post as it regularly provides trustworthy data and insights. 

I look forward to hearing  your perspective and hope to be able to move forward with this story.
