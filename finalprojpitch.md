How has gentrification changed during Covid?

For my final project, I would like to explore the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on gentrification in D.C. As a city that had been experiencing displacement before March 2020, I would like to learn more about if and how the pandemic accelerated the movement of Black people out of DC, and I would also like to analyze the increase of rents in neighborhoods that have typically have a larger Black demographic. I will focus on Wards 5, 6, 7 and 8. 

I will focus on data from March 2020 through December 2021. I think this could be an interesting topic to explore as this has been an ongoing challenge in DC for years, and I am curious to learn more about how the pandemic may have sped up gentrification in the previously mentioned wards. Based on simple and casual observations, I have noticed a large increase of people who are not Black in many neighborhoods that have traditionally been populated by a Black population. As the pandemic affected the livelihood of many, I am curious as to how the impact of COVID19 affected stable housing and affordability for Black people in the aforementioned wards of DC.
