Dear Ms. Lee,

Pursuant to the state open records law D.C. Code Secs. 2-531 to 2-540, I write to request access to and a copy of a list of information on internal agency rules and practices, as I am writing an article on police reforms and whether they have been successful or not in various communities. I am exploring the effectiveness of programs such as yours and would love to learn more about how your agency operates and what specific practices you all use to further your mission and goals. Thank you kindly for considering this request. If your agency does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian's name and address.

I agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $50. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me. Please provide a receipt indicating the charges for each document.

As provided by the Freedom of Information Act, I would request your response within fifteen (15) business days. See D.C. Code Sec. 2-532(c).

If you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.

I would note that willful violation of the open records law can result in the award of reasonable attorney fees and other costs of litigation. See D.C. Code Sec. 2-537(c).

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Rosa Rad
