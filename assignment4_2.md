I am curious to write about athletes in the U.S. who have been accused of sexual assault versus how many of those individuals who have been convicted, over the last 30 years. I think a story about this could be interesting as it is regularly a topic that comes up in professional sports circles but there is rarely any formal data collected to show readers how terrible the conviction rates vs. accusations are. 
I think it could be challenging to collect data for this question, which is why I imagine it has yet to be covered. I believe in order to find accurate data, I would look at 1. Reports of accusations (by looking through web stories on Google News and setting a filter for 1993 onwards), even if the athletes have not been formally charged and 2. different court systems and their dockets and to find information on athletes who have been charged with anything related to rape, sexual assault, and sexual abuse.
